## 💡 What It Does

1. **Home Page**  
   After installing the APK, you land on a clean, minimal welcome screen. Tap the ▶️ arrow to jump into the AR experience.

2. **AR Marker Scan**  
   The app activates your camera. Scan the printed (or on-screen) marker to spawn a sleek 3D car model in your real environment.

3. **Rotate & Paint**

   - The car rotates slowly so you can examine every angle.
   - A row of color swatches appears at the bottom.
   - Tap any swatch to instantly repaint the car’s body—no reload required!

4. **Visual Feedback**  
   Watch how each color interacts with the car’s materials and reflections in real time.
